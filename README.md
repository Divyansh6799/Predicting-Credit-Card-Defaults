# Predicting-Credit-Card-Defaults-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms

In this project, I have performed an end-to-end data mining exercise including data cleaning, distribution analysis, exploratory data analysis, model building etc. to identify and predict Credit Card defaults using Customer's data on past payments and general profile. In the process for building Machine Learning models, I have fit and compared the performance of multiple models and algorithms like Logistic Regreesion, PCA, Classification tree, AdaBoost Classifier, ANN and LDA.I have used the flask for the front-end web application.
